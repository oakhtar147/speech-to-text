hey good morning so to recap what we learned yesterday and employees there's two ways or actually three ways to get into the employee Master record you could double click on the icon of the person and that will bring up the sign list

and then you double-click once you choose the person in the master record you're not only going to have one screen you have the history screen education screen you know what I did not mention this so I will mention this today the adjustment screen I don't know how I missed out yesterday but the adjustment screen is going to be for child support court garnishment or any

deductions that have to be taken out of the employee's paycheck that has nothing to do with taxes just isn't strictly deductions that I needed to be taken out for either like background checks or as I mentioned child support or equipment that you might lend out or rent or Buy and they have to pay it so normally the way that this works is when you get a child support document you could always call tech support and they will walk you step-by-step in order to add it into the records but just as an overview this site here is all the child support or all the deductions that Melissa has when you click then the left hand side is the detail of that equipment or. Deduction so we can see here that this was a one-time deduction cuz it says one time

and she paid $15 for that equipment so you can set up in the production section deductions that are not already included and codes for in background check or equipment or bus tickets or taxi tickets are things like that okay so that is the adjustment screen and it's I know it's a little weird we do it here in the front office but it does follow through into the payroll and it does take it out as probably the biggest overview is that a lot of your information that you put in in the front office is going to assist with the back office getting auto-filled populated because of what we've done the work in the front office then we have the assignment screens which would include all the assignments that she's been on with your company

the bottom half as I had mentioned is all of them and then the top half is the detail of the assignment that you might be on

we have the contact screen which in the contact screen on not only do you are you able to add a contact but you're able to track their availability and you're able to either upload or Dragon drop documents emailed PDF Excel word into the section and be able to review it later on

I also wanted to mention here if you set up a call back I mean that you set up an appointment that you want to have be reminded that you're going to call this person in reference to some type of situation or just for your reminder this call back if you added here but it shows up in a call back calendar and then if you wanted a pop-up reminder if you highlight your call back

and then click on the icon of the email then that sends a invite to your calendar which will have a pop-up reminder

the interview notes is basically a free forming window where you going to be able to type in your notes and then also document any drug testing that you may be doing or background checking

the pay history is going to give you all the payroll batches that are run and then the left hand side is the detail information of each of the people

and then we have to report that you'd be able to print out for your employee if they request the pay registry is a very detailed which would show exactly where some money or his money will be is being taken out of the page summary is going to say this much is deducted but it doesn't give the personal information as to where those deductions are going to

and then one of my favorites is the top screen tell a lot of things happen here in the touchscreen on one of those are that you have to put in the federal information along with the W4 and you're setting up if their Federal single head of household or married or filing jointly and then you're going to set up their deductions for tax deductions like children or additional taxi I did give the W for white paper that explains each of the

characters and give the meaning for that so I could send that along with the state so in your state you'll only have one New Jersey I did not mention this yesterday too but I you could possibly have New York also if you have clients in New York so let me know if you do have clients like in New York or California Connecticut he's so I can send you the state forms for those so that you know what these codes mean and what to put in for state and unemployment and then we also mention that is Jersey does have a disability deduction so I could give information about that but I did forget to ask if I'm being so close to New York if you have clients that are working in New York with that said what happens is that if you have New Jersey and New York on the grid

the system will know based on the job order and the client record that we're about to go over today what caps is to pull for that employee based on that level so one time or one transaction he might get New York and the second transaction he might get

New Jersey so it just really finna T-Pain

where they're working at

and also in the tax section you have the ability to add for pay card or direct deposit if you do not fill these out then the system will automatically print out life check okay

so now we got it the employee

and they're in our system and let's go over the status is again cuz you're going to see those to confirm means that they aren't a job and move forward to get paid for payroll accepted means that they accepted the position but they're not confirmed yet so they're not going forward to payroll you're interviewing could be with you or your clients pending can be pending interview pending testing sending paperwork left a voice message mean that you left a message with there was a more appearing or someone else we called means you did not we're not able to leave a message so you going to recall them available that means that they're available to start working you've changed their status from you which is the status that comes is a default status for a new employee to available meaning you got it down there ready for work

rejected me that the that the employee rejected the position that you offered them

crying rejected means that the car I rejected them and that could be for a good reason or to be for poor reason and you will have the opportunity in the job order section to write a note as to why the client hybrid jacket that employee

can you have no call no show or no show no call

we have finished means the employee finish the assignment that will push him forward to go get paid one last time we have any are which is not eligible for rehire

can we have temp to hire direct the higher and inactive now in active one of the reasons why we might use an active would be because if

you're in a state where you have a lot of people that travel or leave and then come back you may not want them to show up in your job order should search his all the time you may not want that so if you want to report and you see that that employee hasn't been calling in for maybe six months maybe three months you might make them inactive and they won't show up in a job order search

but then when they come back and they are saying all we're back we were out of town we were in the military or whatever they may say then you could change him their status back to available and not have to create a brand new worker for that so that's one of the reasons why you might use inactive

okay so the second section in the front office tab is going to be client so I'm going to show you how to add a brand new client to the system when you click on the client icon you're automatically going to be opened up to a client record and the add button when you click the add button the system will always ask you are you sure you want to add a new customer you'll can say okay or cancel if you hit cancel it will just cancel that advice the second thing that will pop up which a lot of people forget this part is your region branch and department so yesterday I briefly mentioned that your company setup will have a region which is the company name or the company State then it has a branch which means your physical off at your location so maybe your New Jersey in Edison but then you are

so have a another building in Union City so that would be one region New Jersey for ABC stopping and then two punches one would be that as soon as the other one would be Union City and then the Departments are what are you placing are you placing critical industrial or you can make it very general and say temps and then internal stop so you don't have to break it down but the reason why this is important is because this is what causes system where to pull reports and where the hell's your transactions so if I

place my new client in West Side Phoenix under industrial then that's where I'm going to be able to find their report and I'll be able to pull that so you do have to choose where you want your client to be and if you don't you like what I say I say oh no I don't know so I don't choose please don't think that you didn't choose cuz what happens for some reason the system chooses for you and it just chooses the default so when you go to find an employee you're going to find that you may have an empty low with a number and you're like what is that why do I have so many of those well that was just a employee record that was created

that was never fill each fully finished so there's two things you can do for that one is you could absolutely erase that or delete it so if you come forward and you see me like a messed up so I'm going to click delete and then it's going to say are you sure you want to delete and you'll say okay

in the client was deleted the second option that you actually have would be to actually use it so somebody tried to use it and finish it was still a good number so that I could do is go to the region down here make sure that it's where I wanted to be so I do want it to be on Phoenix industrial double click on that and then I could come up here and start typing the name of the client so maybe the name of the client is

I'm not very creative so I apologize let's say Warehouse

warehouse eggs okay and then you'll table over to description so what's the description of this company Warehouse a maybe they're industrial you could just a industrial maybe there are Warehouse companies is a warehouse maybe it's for forklifting you can say forklifting it's good to have a description because if you have a description that you could always find your client prior that description

I want to mention one other thing of if you do choose to delete

I wanted you to know that if you delete your going to delete the number that was created and that number will never show back up to what I mean by that if I sort my, by ID number you see that have one skip to that have three four five six seven eight I don't have Diamond might have been records that were deleted you're never going to get that number again so just keep that in mind problem I just want to make sure that you're aware of that because sometimes clients want to make sure that they have all the numbers in order so bare bear in mind that if you just delete a record here to delete that number and that's not only in this module it'll be in all the modules another point about delete is that the system will never allow you to delete a client that actually has transactions

so if I have 21st Remodeling and I try to delete it this is Alaskan do I want to delete if I say yes it's going to take cannot delete an account with job orders so right away I can't delete this client because once it has jobs orders to it and then to it also has invoicing so that person or stupid a client big house payments that they made or need to be paid so this isn't will never delete that the same thing with the employee Master record if you try to delete him that's honor cited or have been paid the system will not delete that to keep that in mind

so let's go ahead and how would I find an employee client that I've already created again you could go to find and you can find them by the number or find them by their name so we're going to go to we're not very original but that's all I had this morning so I'm sorry and I wanted to continue as an employee record its top top to go through the employee field or the master field so let's save it there in 24

B Lane

told you're not very Creative Suite 202

it's going to it's going to skip the city and state to put a zip code and yesterday I forgot to ask you guys what your ZIP code was in

New Jersey

we have a question is the delete control for active job orders of a client or four clients with any transaction even in the past that's a great question any transaction as soon as there's a job order you cannot delete now in the maintenance we do have a purge

option where you can Purge employees but I believe that those have specific part Terriers and I do believe that again if they have our transaction meaning that you gave paid an invoice that you cannot delete those are also employees cuz you need that for your financial records great question so can someone give me your ZIP code in New Jersey any zip code would be fine

and yes on the same question about the employee Master record that is the same is there an employee and they've been paid or they're on a job order you will not be able to delete them even in the perception they would not be able to be purged

okay the zip code of 07071

okay 07070 788 Lyndhurst Ave Lyndhurst New Jersey and you saw how the system automatically added the city in and out of the state know the billing area this is a field that does not have to be sold out if the building is going to be the primary address its apartment address is the same as billing that you do not have to fill out this side of the client records however it's it's a different address if they say okay then you definitely do want to fill out the billing address because that's where the invoices are going to go to select a PO Box 578

and then I'll know sweet and then we're going to do the same zip code

okay now normally you should be able to come in to hear to that field and type in a name of a person however this is a little different so instead of being able to type in a person we're actually going to create different department heads and we'll be able to use the drop-down box to choose the department has that we want for not only the primary contact but also for who's the attention going to be on the invoice so in order to be able to add a contact Department had we're going to go right here to department and when you click on it it's going to open a new window and then in order to a department we're going to click on ADD and then the system of course we'll ask you do we want to add a new record and will say yes then we'll have the same kind of window that we had when we were adding an employee

which was salutation name we're going to name this person mark

a middle initial last name

Smith told you I'm not very creative today and this is like the third the fourth and then click okay when we click okay then we can say what the part Marcus from maybe he's human resources

and then title maybe he's the office manager

then as you saw or as you can see right here 201 is the area code that was automatically populated from the ZIP code that you guys gave me so then if that's not his cell phone number but it is the office number we could always or if that's not the office number you could always highlight over the number that's incorrect and type over it okay

what's the best way to handle if a number is incorrect in your not sure where your cursor is at maybe he's extension 3

then the office number and then his cell number

now what they're doing here is actually creating a contact information so that you can have his information like you do in Outlook having a contact in Outlook so we're going to make him

his email address but I where am I

I didn't like that

okay

so we have Mark

less

Warehouse

a.com let's just say we did actually enter his birthday if we want to do a list and then in this section here under contacts we're going to write notes what do we know about Mark so much been with the company

20 years

he has two grown

children

and that's all we know by Mark okay person that

was our invoice person then I would be done and I would close out but since I also need a person for invoicing cuz Mark is not the person again I would click on add to add a second record or my second Department person so maybe this time we have a ruby

Rose

and she's with accounting

and she's office manager

or just manager

and her phone number

and her email

and then the notes now this is something that has been happening and I didn't mention it to

tech support that way you add a second person the notes of your first person are showing up you just can't delete that and then go ahead and type in the notes for your second person there are looking into it so I just do want to let you know that that is a known issue okay it's not envy that you did it's just something that programme has to so let's say Ruby only works

on Tuesdays and Wednesdays

are Tuesdays and Thursdays let's just said I could come in here to the little icon to the drop-down box and choose our department had so Mark is at your apartment and if those are his phone number and his extension and then for Ruby will come in here and it filled out her phone number and extension and also your toenail.

you also know that her email will be attached because it's part of the information that we had it so yesterday I mentioned to you that all our modules have a valid button letting us know that there's something that's missing if you ever see your record that is red you could always click on it and then let you know what's missing so for this record what is missing is are T cells in our regular sales and basically that has to do with right here are

internal staff who is the salesperson for warehouse a so let's say that it is

Jesse so all you do is choose your drop down box and find your name or you could have come up here and typed in the name of the person

and then the salesperson in the prospect person they could be the same so if I brought them in and I'm also going to manage them I could also use my name. This is not where commission comes from this is just reporting for contact purposes commission is going to come from the job order and a person that actually confirms and finishes the person okay so the disable auto populate today's date and then we also have a populate auto-populate of default

usage type that uses type is something that is needed for a lot of our report and basically wasn't you just type says is what is the main

work type that this client will be placing so let's say that this client will be placing industrial mostly then you even though it does have a default you can choose a drop-down box and choose a different default default will carry over to the job order and you can still change it as a job order this is basically saying hey every time we place a job order for warehouse a there going to be an industrial type but we do know that sometimes our clients even though majority are for a specific type they call us for something else is it hey do you possibly can find me a secretary for that purpose we're not going to change your YouTube type because that's only a one-time off what we would do is in the job order we would change the usage type and I'm going to take a quick minute to show you where the default

in coats

sew-in maintenance

you're going to see these three gears and if you hover over the gears is going to tell you what their names was the names of the gears are so user will allow you to have user preferences

branches it's been allow you to type in your defaults for your company's and your different locations and then the last one is global so in global that's where you going to be able to find the default and set everybody generally as industrial if you like to

and then at the level type you can change that

every time you do a change in maintenance you do have to close out completely of the system in order for that change to take place if you do not do that then the change will never take place and that's really important especially for this system administrator if for some reason of user doesn't have access to a certain module and they need and then you go into the system and add that module to them but then forget to close out and refresh it or you pull down to refresh it and they don't close out their clothes and refreshes the change will never take an effect but now that we've closed out if we go back to maintenance let me go back to the global gear we can see that are changed tuck

get back to front office back to clients

and then we're finding our client

Warehouse egg and double-clicking

finance charge that is another default set that you can say every time I add a new employee I want a finance charge message to be added what that means is that when you create an invoice for that at the for the client at the bottom it will always say if you don't pay within the date the days that you said

and the percentage that you said it will let them know that they will get charged a percentage if they don't pay within those days if you wanted that message for everybody but not for this one then you can just uncheck it and it will not show up in their invoice so again you can make it a default for everybody or you could not set it up to default and just individually added but those are your options the next section sales tax that is an additional sales tax on a labor that is no sales tax or taxes that need to be taken out you know for state and Company wise so if there is a state tax in New Jersey which I hadn't heard of anything what happens is in maintenance you have to set up the

the mask and the subtraction and then create a username for it then you would be able to come down here and do a download and choose it so right now the two states that we do know for sure that have some additional State on taxes is Pennsylvania and Ohio so if this is something that New Jersey doesn't have or that your county has let me know because then I would want to create a trip ticket so that we can create that for you so you could be available for your job down drop down box use me and then in invoicing when we go there I would show you how to apply

dad

for that invoice for that client okay another note to even if you have the finance charge is just a friendly reminder the system does not automatically charge a finance charge this is a physical manual step that you have to do in order to apply all the finance charges to your client and that's something that's going to be shown in AR

okay we have a question

so yes the maintenance shop is available to all users at least user I believe you can restrict branch and you can restrict Global that's a great question and let me just double-check real quick okay cuz we're on it

tell when you're setting up

your maintenance your company has a system administrator that would be able to create a user and that's how you're going to get your login

and then come into your own individual

user and set up your

security lights

and I'm going into security real quick to maintenance and

all of these Global Branch all of those can be

secured

and then I'll show you kind of what it looks like

so I made myself a system administrator and then I took it away and then I wasn't able to like give myself access to certain windows and I'm like I believe there was another user that I knew their username and password and they were system of ministrator thank God because if not I was going to have to talk to tech support and have them reset me it was going to be embarrassing but I went to maintenance and now I would like to go to Global so what happens is that it'll say you are not authorized entry to this area so now I know okay I can't go into Global but let's say that that's a mistake and I'm supposed to go to go cuz I have to make changes to your system administrator and then they'll give you access to that okay that's not something that you call coach we don't have access to that we don't make sense Unlimited

you've selected your system administrator and that person is responsible for your

security rights great question

you probably live on let's talk about search real quick so just like in the employee record that we saw yesterday we had a fine and then we also have a serged this search is more robots that can allow us not only to search by the client but by car and ID by description also by statuses of clients that I haven't gone over yet and also the potential of the client so as we had talked in

in the employment records anytime you see a grid you have the capability of right-clicking on the header and you're always get this grid tool box and the crypto box the main things that I have is hide a column or column Chooser in a column Chooser you could actually add more columns to your grid to customize it to the way you want to listen it's really important for me to find out the days that I entered that person or I want to know the type to salesperson Austell status item into

my column and then in order to save it so that I don't have to add it each time I go in I'm going to go to save that layout now I've added it and let's say that I want to move it around so the date that have entered that person I actually want that to be the first title or the first column

and then

Embarcadero okay

now we're going to see is that there's going to be multiple clients and the ends the same client but the reason why they're there multiple times is cuz it's showing you all of the contact people

and their department hat okay

cell phone number maybe I don't need that then I could again hi. Column maybe I don't need it for this record but I want it for a later time I could I don't have to say that

and then there's the default and I miss you too late because when I saved it I saved it with the default Warehouse so that's why I was always Keen Warehouse so now I can actually come in here and say hey I'm looking for Bliss Tech

or let's just say blue and then I'm also looking for a very good status so now you can see that I'm going to get a list of anyone that had BBL in their name so public and I started a very good so now I can go ahead and bring that to print and have a list of my clients that I looking for bass on the sort this or excuse me I could always remove the sort by going into a column and changing that or at the bottom here there's a little Chuck box that gets created and I can always uncheck it in order to be able to refresh it

okay

now one last thing I wanted to show you is the ones that are not check these are clients that are inactive meaning that you don't have them in your main screen so you can see 7-Eleven manufacturing if we look at that that's letting us know that there an inactive client if we go here to find you're not going to see 711 manufacturing because the fine people only show you active clients and not clients that are inactive okay I wanted you to know that in order to find inactive clients you would want to go to the search button and then what you can do is uncheck it so that it could show you all your clients that are inactive and these are all are in a compliance

that would not show up in our

find module because he will only show the active ones

okay in this section here you would put in there ww.w Walmart

wall

mart.com I don't know if I spelled it right and that is just basically for their the company's email address I'm sorry website for this was and I spelled it wrong not the right Walmart so this will take you to that client website so this allows you to create a client website right here and then be able to

access it referred by is basically who or how the pine hear about us didn't hear about us doing employee buy newspaper from another client do Yellow Pages to walk in LinkedIn and you create that

okay

printfection and including an email that just means that when we run report that the client will be included in these reports and when we won including mailing that means that on this car and we'll be in the list of creative list to send out some kind of mail in reporting that we have to start assist so when you add a brand new employee to the system their status is Prospect their Foster cuz they don't have a job attached to them active will be once we've had a job order to them then the system will automatically make that client in active client then we have closed office do not service

inactive no longer using all of those other statuses we type those in or we choose them the office was closed so we choose that started that automatically makes the client in active and won't show up in my find anymore

see how they're not in my find

now the only other

Scott is a sometimes gets operated is do not serve it that happens when you have a client that goes over your AR credit limit which I'll be talkin about in a moment okay and now I'll show you guys in a moment so just text him here again is for notes so if you know that this client only want

uniformed

Warren sorry

jumpsuits

why did note so you know that you have to let the client the applicants know that they have to wear a jumpsuit or whatnot and any other information that you think it's important for the employer's to see that your attempts to see and know about the client in sales that's where you can actually write the notes about the client so or you know like I called Mark

to welcome him

to A & B Staffing

now every time you write a note sorry guys I can barely see cuz it's so tiny and my fingers are so big okay every time you find out you're going to be able to type in the visit type and the potential of. Know these two it is important to fill out because it's going to create a report report for client sales analysis that you'll be able to see and review and you can possibly use that report for

quarterly bonuses and things like that so it said that I called Mark so I can click on phone and then on based on the potential of a phone call I could say good or very good or Fair okay so now I have that note and then it's going to try to every time I write a know I'm going to want to click on a visit type and a client potential where that's going to show up

is going to be under report under the maintenance or management report and it's called sales analysis so in the same now it says I could come in here and it is going to be by a date range so I'm just going to do fourth quarter and I'm going to click on myself

and then it's going to show me a report of all the contacts that I've had for this 4th quarter

well actually just expected one but as you can see I have four calls that I've made one email that I've done this quarter and I haven't visited anybody I haven't have any appointments I haven't had any face-to-face and only one client is a potential strong clients so that number is pulling on all that information is pulling from the sales

window

senior client

record

okay just like in the employee record we have a dragon drop or an upload to were able to add the contract agreement or were able to add any emails that I sent has any documents that they sent off and we could also track

the client if we want to call them back right putting in a call back

bubble show up in our car back if I wanted that to go into my Outlook then I could click on the Callback appointments Outlook which will send that appointment to my Outlook and I was saved the other option that you have to is peak time this creates a report of when peak times for this client is maybe his peak time in October November December then you can run a report in client to say hey what are the peak times for my car ins for the month of October and then Warehouse a will show up and you might then send them an email saying hey I know you're about to get started in your pee time let me know if you need anyting

any questions

hi we're going to go to 21st remodeling

and the person going to see which one he first remodeling is this alert button this alert button is this an alert that we had in the employee records it's a note about that client that you can type in so that each time you go into that client or anybody goes into that client records they can read your lurk So I says to me not to book anything until he's paid his last invoice so if I'm not done with that no I can click on shade so that later on I'll still have that reminder. The reason why that kind is Red is because when we go into the credit we can see that we set up an 8 oz limit of 70,000 he's over by 2002 the system will automatically make him over the credit limit and not allow us to

at a job for that client

so what I mean by that is if I was to come here to orders to add a job for that client

and I opened up my job order

for that client and I click

add

I'm going to get an alert that says that I am unable

add an order for that client bear with me one second

seems like it got stuck

and it froze on me

it's okay

all right it's definitely Frozen on me there if you want, it's cuz it has to be

that's a great question that's the question is does the kind have a portal for them to add job orders to bear with me one second before I answer that question I just wanted you to know that I am knowledge the question there was me one second

coach does have in a client portal and an employee portal

bear with me one second

it's not

it's not an item that comes with the system is a optional feature and if you are added to your system then yes the client will be able to look at the invoices and then also add job orders request to the system through the portal and it's called the client portal

just bear with me

I am so sorry

all right Coats were going to close you out

and also I'm going to close out the calendar

so that it doesn't freeze up on me if you need a calendar we can look at that later

all right

thank you for your patience

all right let's try that again to here's your job order

and then when I click on ADD it's going to tell you are you sure you want to add a new employee on your new job excuse me and then it lets me know that the client is do not service or there over the credit limit to recognize is that as over the credit limit and does not allow me to add a new order for that client that's exactly what we want what is

we wanted to override that then what happens in order to override that is that you would either change your AR module two little higher

to allow them to not become over to a our limit anymore and you'll be able to add job orders for them some clients do not

give me one second on the question sometimes do not even fill this out they just do not want to fill that out and that's an option as well the system will always still track the current balance but it will not make them over the AR limit or under the limit if you do not have a number there and what is the question

can all the users change the AR limits that's a great question so yes I know that is a restricted module all of the different modules in different windows can be restricted so that's not something that everybody needs to have access to you definitely want to lock it down. Why should you under each user under their user security you just will not check that offer them on the same thing with the AR all of our modules

Roosevelt Field's I should say Okay so the next module is the AR that is where their invoices is house so even though in two days I'm going to show you how to manually or automatically or manually send invoices out as a whole after they're sent out as a whole the individual invoice will be housed in clients in the AR window this allows you to be able to do changes and or resend to your client if they hadn't received it the default is always open orders or open to the open invoices or you can choose to look at the clothes invoices what they paid or you can look at a combination of both

are the default will be open invoices and as in the other windows the right hand side is a list of the invoice

the left hand side is the details of who's on that invoice

you also have the opportunity to print out a statement and a summary statement and we can also refresh data from here that means if we made a change and we want to refresh the data in order for the change to come forward and what is let's look at one of the invoices really quick let's say that this invoice was incorrect in the client called me back and said hey I received the invoice but you have Charles working 40 hours and he actually only worked 30 so you actually could come in here again if you have access and rights to it to change that and what you would do is you would click on the paper and a pen which would open the debit and credit and then you would manually change the hours to 40 and because you're doing that manually you do have to do

the

calculations manually as well so what I mean by that is that you're going to have the 30 hours time the 15 hours rate or the 15 rates and that's going to change the amount to 450 and whatever you do to the one side you must do to the other side in this

module for the debit and credit

and then you can close out so what happens here is that that's going to change when I click refresh

and now you can see that it changed his unit hours and then from here we could actually print out the invoice and mail it back to our client or we could email it back to a client and that's how you'll do the change any invoice changes need to be done within the client record and then this is actually a custom invoice with a client in logo and this is a customization where a client wanted to have

sorry the client wanted to have the hours accumulated

and tech support would be able and programming excuse me what be able to create a customization invoice and then and then of course we have our default invoice which I will show you what that looks like. Do one second think maybe 7-Eleven has a default or our regular default okay

and this is our regular default it is a sister company that we used to have Reliance your invoice the client ID client po that will split an invoice and then it is based on last name of the employee description what deal what they work regular hours overtime hour the number of hours then the rate of the client and then the total amount that the bottom here is their receipt and you can see that it says due upon receipt and that they have to pay this within 30 days or the finance charge will be added that start with a finance charge if I did not want that to be on my invoice at all then I could just uncheck it and when I go back to the invoice AR in the back to my print icon you will see that it will not say that anymore and or warm is still said it it shouldn't say it it's just a do upon receipt

okay we do have the history Grid or an aging report and this would be just based on that one client there is a aging report for all your clients in a r but this right here anything that you do in this client record is going to be specifically for that client

so that's are aging report

I want my thing I wanted to show you what's a collections window this collection Windows does have a couple of things attached to it we have pre-created letters like this 30-day letter that you can assign someone to like me be myself and the date that you want to send it maybe we're going to send it tomorrow and it's just going to say that this is a friendly reminder that these are past due these invoices in unless the invoice and the total

then you have a 45 Day letter a 60-day letter and a 10-day letter the man now all of those are still letters just sent out by you we do have a sent to collections which does actually sent out an email to a company that we partner with Adams Evans and Ross and then when if you click on that that's letting them know hey we would like for you to send this company or start the process to send this company to collections we also have a credit report again that sends an email to Adam Evans in wall stairs I believe a 1295 ft in order to get a credit report for that client the R Us are pretty created letters and even though the other 10 days and time does look like it comes from Adam Evans in walls it's not you're still sending it yourself

he just has their information on there

and it's letting them know that this is now do so does have their information and saying that the above claim will be placed for recovery

if you don't receive payment within 10 days

a lot of stuff in the AR section we do have a gross margin gross profit and that's again a report based on a date range for this this one client and gives you their gross profit and your markup percent

this is a drill down report and what I mean by that is that anytime I double-click I'm going to get not only the region but I'm going to be able to get the city scuse me

branch and then if I drop down again I'm going to be able to get the department and if I drop down again I'm going to be able to get the client so it is a durable and then report and then this is the individual job orders for that client

and then we in order to see it in a

chart we had the little chart

the markup percent this is a great field and I'm going to go back to 21st remodeling I believe that I'm sorry I want to go back to our warehouse I believe that you had asked a question how does the client how does the employee get a spine a

workers comp yesterday that was one of the questions how does the employee get assigned a worker's comp so right away this is how I was just was a default this markup percent window can be a default to so what this means is that you know every time we're going to put in a order for warehouse we know that is going to be skill code

industrial or labor whatever skill code that we have

okay that's going to automatically move forward to every job order we add unless we manually change it now on top of that we can setup a default pay rate and a default on mother and we have a GMP worksheet that would allow us to review whether our markup percent is correct or beneficial to us so this is a tool that comes with the system

that based on the skill code that we added and based on

overhead and taxes and additional dollars it will let us know whether or not we're making a profit so the first one is really what we're going to be building the client may we were building the client $14 and the employee is getting $12 but they so that's going to be a markup of 16 and that's not going to really give us a lot of money and you can see that by changing the number of hours were saying that we're actually losing $0.43 by doing that all right so that we can actually come in here and say what what would a 30% markup would be so now with a 30% markup we're actually making a dollar and $0.15 for the hour with all of the

taxes being reduced - cuz he's going to - workers comp - overhead minus taxes and any additional taxes in this is what a prophet is and as your salespeople they can create these and print them out and bring home with them to Amy's sales meetings that they have or they can log into the computer and access to run different scenarios till for disenteria I like the fact that we're going to do $12 an hour at a 30% markup so then I can decide that that's going to be our market for this client for each time we add a job order and then at the level at the job water level if I have to change it because the job is for something different then I can do so okay so I'm going to set that up also want to mention is these are the overtime modway and

and double-time moderate what does what does mean to you is that the system will know it's going to pay time-and-a-half or double time but if you wanted to create a discount for a client because you have a lot of employees in there what you would do if you would put in what you're going to build a client for any overtime that again or you going to bill the client just checking him out but he double-time it again and what happens is in payroll the system will know based on this to pull

this bill that you created instead of the overtime okay

can I set that as my default we do have a map

so the map what that does is that pulls from your address of you set up in maintenance to the address of the client and then gives you a dingbat place that you can print out or you can go into the note time and type in 20 miles from the office to write so it's up to you as to whether or not you would use the knob or you would type in handwritten to descriptions to print out to the employees but important is where is that map and maintenance so again we're going to go to maintenance

we're going to go to Global this type of branches and right here where it says map address that's where he's going to add the map address coach is taking this address

or actually I'm in Phoenix cuz this client was Phoenix so if I go to Phoenix it actually doesn't even have an address and that's why I did that go here real quick

none of them have it copy

23452

not there

here

can I get it

2345 individual department head for scuse me each individual Department Branch will have its own

map address so you can add to the system

I got a little impatient I might have opened it a couple of times

yep you seeing home

alright so let's go back

go back to Warehouse a

and I've got back to that MapQuest now that we have an address there it's going to pull that address

funny Jersey and you can see

normally I can't find and it's not an accurate address but normally it takes the zip code in like told you 17 hours or 9 hours and only does that mean I'm hoping it. But it did it say we can't find the directions for the journey because one or more Waypoint we're not found it could be that there's not a lane so that's my fault okay then we have benefits the benefits allows you to add like benefits of the client might be offering so let's say that after we work with a company for 3 months they'll give you one day vacation or they do pay for holiday pay things like that you can put in the benefit information window it is a free-form in window meaning you just type in there this is a great window but I do have to change client to show you that window

because this is going to pull all the employees for the stirring client that you have and because we don't have any employees yet which one is with Warehouse be we're not going to be able to run anyway so I'm going to 21st remodeling what we can do is click on ample and basically say hey I want to see who has worked for me for this month or whatever date range that I want to add and I can say start with the date range and with the date range or I can take start with start date or end date and basically what that means is going to look for any employees that work for me for that client during that end date and then you can be very specific on the status like if you only want to see confirm people or only finished

but for the purpose of today I'm going to do all statuses that way I can have some report and I'm still not yeah because they are still not sure I'm going to get anybody because I don't think I placed anybody for this month so what I can do that weighs go to the date range and I actually can go to first quarter

and now I could on so anytime you want to choose a pre-created range you can click on date range and that will take you there if this doesn't bring anybody for more than I could do last year and I definitely know I have people for last year but no first quarter I did have people and then you can see that it's another grid and I could look at the statuses so all my people I had everybody's that was finished and only one confirm what I can do here with this report is a couple of things one I can send them all a text if I needed them to know that the client wants to rehire them or I can send an email the other thing I can also do is print out a report so want you to bear in mind though that when you print out a report from this grid even if you hide a column it's still going to show up in your report

so let's look at pay let's have wanted to hide pee and I hid it here from my columns but then I come to print out a report you're going to see that even though you print out the report the pay oh it didn't show that okay so maybe they fixed it

I know something always showed up when you print it out maybe it's not from print screen all right well that's good to know but if you do come up with a printing problem or that something didn't show up definitely give us a call or call tech support we have usage and search search is going to be a reverse search usage is normally going to pull from the optional features that you created in the employee Master rapper so I say okay my clients they want someone as bilingual they may want someone that is

forklift certified

and they're looking for those type of employees and then the way that the search works is that if you go if you're in the office and someone gives you the resume and you see that there bilingual and Elsa forklift certified but you can't remember what client wanted that you could go into search

until the system to give you a report of bilingual and the forklift certified and then what the system does it gives you all the employees that were looking for a nanny that were looking for forklift certified

anytime you could reach out to those clients and say hey I have an employee that came in here and they're bilingual and they're also forklift certified and I want to know if you'd like to receive their email or your resume. Email and that's what you would use the search for

called ID reverse search

okay so we talked about we talked about to leave copy basically copies your

sorry I don't know why I did that copy basically at your report

I have a question give me one second for that copy will just copy your actual crime and allows you to do some changes and the reason why you may have a copy maybe that you have one parent company but they want different warehouses to have different billing addresses so you might create a second company name with a different billing address so that's one of the reasons why you may use copy

do we have to always add pay bill rates for modify Ott

or can there be a set modded for double actually it's already said you don't have to go in there and set double time and overtime even though it's not there it's sad

this was only you would only touch this if you needed it to be a different Bell if you wanted a bill the client a different number

that's a good question and I will confirm that to make sure cuz I do see where the time and a half for double time overtime wasn't added but I believe that it is defaulted already and I will confirm with tech support and I will include that in the email that I sent you a great question

that's a great question we talked about search order I showed you if you click on the water that's automatically going to take you to the orders section but very specifically it's going to take you only two that clients order so you would go to orders if you're doing an order for that specific client that you may want to enter some hair and you can go into orders that way I'm going to show you a second way to going to order it then we also have a calendar and remember I had mentioned to you guys before that this comment in the employee record and now in the car record isn't a calendar for you to call back but this is a calendar in case you created a schedule and you want to be able to see it in the client record

which I'll be showing you that in a little bit we talked about the apartment

I wanted to show you that when we added the zip code and I'm actually going to close out of here for a second and go to Warehouse

Hey cuz that you can see where we look at the tax code it automatically pulled from the main address that is going to go in the job order so it's ever in your life or in your business you have a client let's say that their corporate address is Florida but their job is in New Jersey you may want to Dan instead of having the tax code B Florida you may want to change it to New Jersey so that when you do at a job order to for that client it will pull New Jersey and you're not going to get an error validity in payroll where each time you going to have to change it every time every time every time every time so that sometimes happens when client have Corporate Offices outside of where their actual office is remember that coaches go

to pay the taxes for where you're physically working at so that is one of those places where you could actually come in here to taxes and change it into corporate address is different cuz this is what's going to pull into payroll the GL information you normally don't go in there but this is something that happens automatically because we set it up in maintenance ahead of time so you would only go in here if you need to change it and then invoicing this allows you to either ask for the client to receive their invoices email and have an email address

okay and then you get out of c c and a b b a b c see if the client was emailed and print that you have to check them both the other section is for customs ization of an invoice and you have for maybe volume discount and then the Last Action is to add billing for the Affordable Care Act and this also can be set up and Global as a default for all your clients or you can come in here individually and say all clients are going to be in Boys by percentage except for this client that's going to be by hours so this allows for some customization

okay then we also have the print

icon

which will just print out a report of your client with your client email address and the contact information for your clients

this is a mail merge which again

I have mentioned you could create letters or cats that you want and create memes for them and then create mail merge and what the mail merge is basically you're pulling in field from the client Master record to autofill each time you send that letter out to your not having to type in those feels like name address contact number and information and it's just a it's a generic letter that you're sending out and then let's look at the prince

report which is just going to give you the contact information not the contact information but your company report like I mentioned address Warehouse

and then the company departments that we added in any looks that we have

alright so before we move on is there any other questions that you might have about clients before we moved over to pay with two orders

so I mentioned two things there's two ways to go into orders you either going to orders by the client by clicking on orders or you can go into orders by coming into this header and clicking on order

redhatter what you're going to see is that you're going to have a list of all your open orders and it's going to be all of your open orders okay if you go in through by the client excuse me

if you go in by client

then it's only going to list the client that you're currently on like we did for 21st modeling it only showed us 21st remodeling

when you go into an order for the first time like Warehouse a we've never created a job order for them and we create a job order for that the system will let us know that this client doesn't have a job order it's kind of like I hate it. This crying doesn't have a job order and then you could click okay and it's going to open up a brand new job order for that client

what it pulls forward

hold on a second

cuz it didn't pull my default

oh I didn't set it up as my default I'm sorry all right I didn't bring forward to default to my first order because I didn't have it set up as a default but that's okay

it does pull forward the company number the company ID it pulls in an order number and an order ID so the order number is actually the number of orders that this client has within your company so this is actually the first order that job that warehouse a house with us but as a company as a b Staffing this is the first this is the 990 first sorry 9126 that are really important to have in a job order in order to make a payroll very successful

the main thing is a start date even though you have an order date that is not a start date so you must have a start date and that's number one you have to add a start date

an MK is not needed but if you want to record you can use an end date of maybe a month or two weeks that is not going to finish an employee you manually have to finish an employee that's just as a report holder a placeholder for report to shake hey you predicted that the job was going to be funny ended in two weeks or you predicted that the job is going to be a month and it ended in 4 months to check a placeholder it doesn't finish people so still number one number two who is that pay rate remember that we need that pay rate without a pay rate than the purse

the persons

Simon card is going to go into payroll with 0 and it's a payroll person doesn't catch that they don't have a pay rate they're going to add hours and is anything times 0 is going to be 0 and check for them the sports section that's needed is a bill rate and the Billy and amaka person I actually attached to each other till you know that the bill that the markup percent should be 30% and it will automatically change your bill rate to the proper Bill rate so it's looking at 30% OK and these are together so those are needed so we have or today

1K wait to fill rate with markup percent 3/4 is that skill code we need that skill code that is attached to workers comp beatbox that are setting up are going to go and attached himself to the employee Master records without these default employee assignment card is going to be zero or empty and then if you confirm them to move them for work they're not going to go forward another option to why you need to start date is that if you don't have a start date

and you confirm a person they won't move forward without a start date they will not move forward with out a pay rate and Bill rate and skill code they will move forward if you have that starts and confirm them so that's why it's important to either have a defaulted as always there or have a practice in place a plan in place that you practice all the time in order to make sure that these items are added

the fish item is that a user type default use which is already a default in the client types so because we created it as a default it came forward so that's number five number six will be a confirmed status you have to confirm in a party to go forward to payroll okay my mother feels that you may want to fill out which are not needed but you may want to have it it's a department head remember we created Mark II by clicking on that empty space we will get up the department live and then we could just double click to add Mark to our department head and then now we have his phone number we have an email just in case we would like to attach an employee Master record to

Mark and send him an a resume if we have resume parsing the employee if you needed all of the rest of these fields are really important in order to run reports on how my productivity for a order is working so you can order to fill that out you do need in order to have that report you do need to fill out these forms because without the use of feels being filled out these reports are going to populate so when are they going to work me to go to work at 8 that's a report time how many hours is this is this job may be in 20 hours a 20 hour work week what is it work time maybe even though they have to report at work it is 8 to 5 job maybe or 8 to 4823 I'm putting in a report to maybe they're going to report to Sunny

how is the dress code remember that needed that uniform

and then the PO this is feel that you're not going to fill out unless you want the system to split an invoice so why would we want that maybe a client has one job order for warehouse a another job order for warehouse be and it wants those two invoices split to contain which of the warehouses is spending more money or you know for any reason they want to have a day shift in the night shift they want to split it typing in PO number there or typing in letters or titles there we'll split the invoice and then we have of course topper am I to suffer that added this job order and my also the stopper that's going to

continue filling in the position that we do have a copy order the copy order does allow you to count in order any copies everything on the left hand side and if I had employees listed it would not copy my employees

what I wanted to mention with a copy with a copy is let's say that I am not the user or the South or the copy that I could come into my little eye icon and then choose the actual stopper that copy that order so that's really important that if you are going to copy in order from the past or for a previous copy you definitely want to be able to ensure that you update the change of the sufferer if you're not.

and now we can see that now disorders order number to because this is the second order for that employer for that client but then it also updated the order for your company before we add employees I did also want to mention in the tax

there within one second

sometimes you have four panels you have the main panel for the job the list of employees that were about to list we have open orders and then we have this panel here that allows us to add delete copy I wanted to show you the tax code so remember that the tax code pulled from the client, so that's why it's New Jersey If this job is in New Jersey you want to leave it that way but it's his job was not a New Jersey and the Klein's offices in New Jersey then you would want to change that tax code and either you change it in this level or you change it in the client level either way you have to make sure that their taxes are going to match with the taxes of the employees that you add now I will know that they're going to be some employees that were an ad here that I'm not going to have the same

taxes in their Master record and I'm going to show you how you would change that if that happens okay

the other thing I wanted to mention is again this here is just a default

at the job order level when we added employee we're going to get an icon for their assignment that is what's going to move forward to pay walk so if I got a Simon level we need to change the pay rate or we needed to change something we would do it individually to be assignment person but if we wanted to do it to the entire order that we would change it here but if we have employees already here than we would have to change it into the individual employee but anybody that we add you would have the new information this is a section for the title so we're going to call this a.m.

shipt

3

statuses each order has statuses as well so an open order reorder excuse me I reopen order and a pending order all of those are considered open statuses and in our status list is going to always be reflected unless we choose the other filters like close all in or client so right now we're looking at a client

list if we wanted to change at 20000 open orders then we're going to see that we have our open order list and in order to find our client we can come in here to our list and click our open order the date that the order

was added then we could do a description so

moving boxes

and then here for notes

we also have a contact window where you can actually contact so you can see that there was a status change and we could also add our own contact will send

2

Champs 4 a.m. shift

remember that I told you yesterday whatever we learn from the previous module we're going to be able to apply to all the modules basically in our system again this is the section where we've we've seen contact screen we can add and drop document we can add it call back letter another going to automatically comes with our job order is a follow-up today's is an automatic follow up that we can say hey bass on that start date we're going to want to follow up with the client and and maintenance we can say we're in a follow-up three days by day 7 days a week and follow up after 7 days after 14 days after 21 days so again in maintenance under branches you would shut up your follow days that you want to create

turn based on the date that we chose as a start date if we're going to follow up on the 2nd on the 9th and on the 16th and if we click on as follow information that's going to add it to the client section and if we click on add to Outlook it's going to send it to our Outlook so we can have an update reminder Warehouse clients and we go back to seals we're going to see those follow-up are there

and if we go to the

calendar

you can minimize this

in school. Call that calendar it's going to be lifted here was founder

so let's go to

make sure that our date range is a little further if I want to make sure that our date ranges till December 1st

and then I changed it to November here are follow-up you will also notice that they're different colors

so the blue is going to be the follow-up for our clients where the green is going to be a follow-up for the employee that we set up Melissa to follow up with her on the 21st

and each module under report has the follow-up call back

report that we will always be able to print and see who we were going to follow up with in a specific month or date so now let's go ahead and add employees to our system there's two ways to add employees to our system we could either come into this icon here with the little plus sign and get a list of all the people that we have in our record and then just either find them like if I want Captain Hook by want hook I could find him and add him to the system is Captain Hook is already working somewhere else I'm going to get an alert in case he's already confirmed at 21 remodeling do I still want to add him let's say that I know that 21st remodeling is a 20 hour work week and this is a 20 hour work week I can take yes I want him to also work with here too so now he's going to be working in two jobs okay

let's talk real quick about what we see here first this is the employee list we have his name address phone number and email address right here without a label is cuz a Simon card if I click on his assignment card I'm going to be able to see of course all the assignments use on but I'm highlighted at warehouse eggs so this is a specific detail Warehouse he's going to get paid $12 an hour

declines can be built at 1560 on the stopper this is the workers comp code that's attached to the skill code and that's what's going to move forward to payroll

for payroll to fill out his

Vanguard the next is global status what is it Global status to us so it shows that he's confirmed and we knew that because when we added him it show that he was confirmed to another client then there's his name then there's the J column the Jacob means what is his availability to the our client Warehouse a Associate's availability to Warehouse is that he's available then we have the option to be able to send him to Outlook or if we have a resume on file for him to send it to the client or removed him or send him a quick text zipwhip or I'm going to show you the freeway to send him a text and a little bit what we've been working toward our screens excuse me so when we pick on screens that's going to open up the skill screen

that we had

look at in the employee Master record we have the industrial behind the clerical one we have a custom creative ones if we want to pull Hospitality or any other ones that we might have created that we have an optional locations cab which this whole I was to be very detail of what we're looking for and then the last time is where we're going to actually ask for a research before putting them on the job order so let's say I am looking for industrial I want someone that has computer skills I mean when someone that has chipping skills they're definitely need to know how to forklift I need them to be able to do the sit down forklift I need them to be able to have a hard time I need them to have a license and then I'm going to click on the word use to tell the system that I want these five items

sorry six items to be included in my search then I might come here and say plus I want this person to be bilingual so here we go adding

that optional feature that we created

we got a quick update and then again we have to click on use to tell the system that we want

got to be included in our church and last but not least or second to last but not least we want to take to drive to Chesapeake because that's where the client is and it's pretty far and we don't want to research or go to anybody that's not willing to drive to Chesapeake we can even add zip codes we could even say hey only anybody that came that were marked available

in the last 2 weeks I can also include that I can include just Les Miserable people or include include my new people and I don't can also include my confirm people so I have those options look at a woman new people come forward cuz I know that my new people I haven't bedded them like a nunchuck that okay and then the last part is to run that church and see what I got you can tell but I only got one person and that probably isn't very

big of a search but I was very detailed so let's see if I go back here and say okay so it's not important I don't need them to drive to Chesapeake I'm willing to choose other people and it don't have to have the last two days last two weeks it could be anybody coming forward but I do mean them to be bilingual so I run that church again and now you can see that I have more people that have been added

so then from here I could actually tell this isn't a I like all these people Adam or shut them off and add them to my order so then I can close out of here and now all these people I could be added to my order automatically all these people are going to have that pay rate of $12 an hour and that bill rate without markup percent

because it was already in the system

it was already created before I added them to the job order so you can see that but let's say that for some reason

I talked to Mike and Mike is going to be the team lead so I want his pay rate to be higher I will individually have to go into Mike's

assignment card and change my Simon car to let's say $14 an hour what do you make a change to the pay the system will automatically want to keep the bill rate the same so I change my markup percent but that's not a problem you just come over and adjusted to the mark-up percent that is supposed to be and that will sorry and that will fit the bill rate

okay to 1812 and then we have a little section here where it says invoice reference where we can say that that was

the reason was for team lead so that's going to show up in his

invoice that he was a team leader to the client to know why everybody else got paid $12 but he's getting paid for that amount of hours

the status says if you click on the dot. Are going to show up so let's say that I called Melissa and left her a voice message she didn't pick up that's when I can click left voice message and then I have a note that I can say last message

formal to call back

let's say I called Maxwell and he said yes and he can do it so then I hear I'm going to come and confirm at 12

and then when you confirm the system always has a placement verification to make sure that we have the I-9 before that we have maybe if we're missing a mail code we could even have a ACA type

to be defaulted so there's a lot of default so you can set up to make sure that the employee has all that before moving forward to pay down mortgage to play summer job confirmed

there are different color codes that you're going to see and I do want to mention where the color codes are because you may see them in the future so in the fourth Channel down here under the eye for information those color codes are going to be listed on this J G Carla mcscuse me an invoice a colored sees me of

green or purple will mean that the purple means the person is possibly flat for unemployment that is something that we can set up in maintenance to say hey if a person Works consecutively these number of days and then is finished bought them as a possible unemployment so we can find them and we can make sure that they get on-the-job the green to mean two things it can mean either Captain Hook is either check for a watching which means work opportunity opportunity to delimit for that year either way these are all good potential important for us because if he met his food us to the Limit that means we're not getting we don't have to be taxed on him or if it's a work opportunity tax credit for him or if he

possibly

unemployment that means that we can confirm him but he doesn't go out and ask for unemployment in the name level down here you're going to see either green or red Greenville mean that they're alien registration expired so we go into Kim's Master record we're going to see that her Inland registration expired if we see someone that's what I said then that means that they're I9 or W-4 was not checked in the main record and then in the J column colors that we might see or yellow because the person is in that any are or rejected by that client that's where that client rejection comes in on orange because the assignment starts that day

teal if we sent a resume on their behalf

gray if we email them or gold if we have texted them

I'm checking to see if there's any questions no questions okay great well we confirm Caroline

and Carolina you can see that at the bottom doesn't alert it's saying that this region is different from her region and the reason why he gives you that alert it's cuz he wants to know if change is cheapies in this region and if she should because that's where her new and she moved to and that's what her new placements are going to be you can do an update but if it's not she just happens to be going to work there for her region is going to be still in the other place then you can just click okay and not make any changes and again you can put in your nose that she confirmed the job

at the bottom you're going to see this confirmed and finished this is these two features are features that I recommend you do not use those are only use for daily pay because if you notice and I'll show you again crystal is available what if we confirm Crystal Ship globally becomes available

if you come from somebody through this confirm button it will not change their Global status because the only people need to be available every day because they're going to be placed on orders on the same thing with finish when we finish someone it we have to manually finish them here by clicking on Fein and then we have the option to say why did they finish and then prays to finish date

and then have a note for them finishing

and that will make them finish and globally available again to play Someone another job if you use is finished it will not change or Global status and again you may have some ways that status is incorrect so you definitely want to be able to and remember what I mentioned to you before this end date does not automatically finish that person you can see that we finish a week later and the job is still available cuz maybe their job ended but everyone else is still on that job in order to remove people that you do not want to call or not going to be on the job order like let's say

Mike and Kim you could actually remove them by clicking on this icon which will move anybody that has a status of available New Orleans active leaving those that are pending or left a voice message or finish available Caroline actually ended her job

but she was really ending her job because she got a job rate of pay rate also cuz she's going to be the second team lead you could actually go back to the assignment

and this is why I was showing you

that you could reassign her

sorry hold on

kawika reassign her and when we reassign her the system will want to choose the today's date for when she's going to be real fine but you have control of that and you can say no she's going to start on the 28th and then this is what we can say she's going to get $14 an hour also and she's team leader too so you could definitely make those changes and Sage team leader to workers comp code is going to be different than we recommend that you do a second or a different job order other than that of Pele change or start change that could also happen within a job-order but if you're going to have a second or a different workers comp code that we recommend a different job order and remember all these

borders the job order we do here in the job orders that we have here cuz we don't have anybody here but if we do all of that is unless we come in here and split the PO which would split the invoices for the different job orders I filled my quota let's say Melissa called back and I confirmed

so now I filled my quota the job is spell they needed three people or do you need it for people are confirmed for people whose daughters are job field cancel client feel competitive field or cannot fill so I can change that that doesn't mean that they're not going to get paid that just means that in my open order on that order anymore

put on I need to clear this so in my open orders I'm not going to have that other open that other Warehouse I'm going to have it cuz it's closed but if I go to close then I'm going to see it and then I could make any changes like if these people are now needing to be finished I can finish them on how you want to handle the status of open and closed order some people leave all the orders open and then they have tons of orders open here and you can tell that when we take away the

short

we can see that we have a hundred and twenty-three Jaws opened

amongst our clients but if we look at clothes orders we can see that we have like six hundred and twenty one thing I wanted to show you things that I know that our time is short and we'll move on. I wanted to see all the orders that Mike was on actually come and click on EMP and this is going to show me a list of all the orders that Mike has been on the orders he's been here he's on here Mike he's on here

Mike and then again if I want to go to specific line and only see their orders I can go to client and then I'm only going to see a list of open and closed orders for that client

am I feeling that I wanted to show you was down here under the print icon

where you're going to get a list and I'm going to open it up a little bit so you can see it reports so the first four reports have to do with a job order that you're actually on so if I click on order this is going to give me a list of everything up just I order that I'm currently on so it's what I needed who I needed how much I needed right

let me go to Warehouse real quick

now if I wanted a list of employees that are on that list I have to choose all of the status because if I only choose confirm status then you and Steve.

Channel

finished Alice will not show up and you know that we finished her also so we want to be able to see that so we're in the click all the statuses that we have

listed on the G, I'm a j column in order to see

all the employees on the list. We have the contact details this is going to be a great report because letter this job is taking you a long time to fill every time we confirm any time we left a message anytime right here left a message and then the message that we left is going to list sad and is going to be the detail of every action that you did within that job order and you'll be able to show your manager like hey this is why it's taking me so long I've called all these people they all said they're going to call me back to haven't called me back and you have something to show for it so I really love that report report is not a report that we actually really Hughes it's four kinds of may not have their own time sheets and this will just print out a regular 87 time card for anyone is confirmed as you can see this is for

Melissa and the next one is for Maxwell to all me to confirm people don't lie jobs open all of them having to do with your open ordered so if I wanted to see all the orders that I have or I want to see all the orders let's say for this for years

Adam had

I can choose Adam

I think I missed them

call Darius

and now I'm going to have a list of orders open and close to actually open and close that Adam had and here is our brand new order the Adam created the warehouse one

with reports of how many people are needed if any of them confirm if any of them finish that information that type of information all your open orders like if you want to have a list of all your open orders cuz you want you might want to close them out based on your game range

you could even have them by the status on the status would be the status of a job order

confirmed can't be filled Kleinfeld dough statuses

this would put it in that order

Securus cancel one job order cancelled 22 job failed

and then orders those reports are very beneficial to you as a client and they're located under the print icon in job order so please bear in mind that they're there also we have the mail merge which I've been talking about so much about but this is where you could definitely create letters or texting with them about to show you how to text and be able to fill that out and then just text it so let's say that I wanted them to know that there's a job open with Warehouse they from 8 to 5 and if they're interested to call Jesse at that number I could copy that

letter that was already created with the information added and come in here to this bottom icon which is the texting icon and that's free texting and anyone that has a cell phone number is going to show up and then I'm going to say the I'm going to text them all and then I'm going to drop mine

note

right here in the middle and remember that I may want to have a subject cuz when it goes into the clients and employees record we want a subject so we can say

are you available

and it'll blind carbon copy everybody so then when I send this out I actually have the option now to add that no to every employee's record or the job order if it was going to go to the job order and when I close out of there and I do go to the same maxwellmane record and I can access his main record from here and I go to his contact you're going to see that. Know that I sent him a text

is right here he was confirmed from the warehouse

call maybe he wasn't on it hold on that's fine that's just showing that he was confirmed from Warehouse hold on

who is my person

listen to Melissa

right here here's the text are you available but if I want to see what the main text was I can click on view going to open up the main taxes they open job Warehouse a from 8 to 5

alright any questions

the resume down here that's only if you have resume parsing and what that allows you to do is actually bring people forward into the job order list through a resume by attack so if I go into my resume database and I say I'm looking for forklifter is going to show me anybody that has forklifter in their resume and I can add them to my job order and then call them up but basically what I do want you guys to remember is the six things that are needed in order for this person to go to payroll the other thing I wanted you to remember is that the find button has a lot of reports available to you to be able to manage your open orders and be able to manage your career in order they gone and then you have the availability of your

job order list to be able to search your job orders if you change their statuses okay

all right well that concludes today's training on clients and orders I will be sending out the recorded
