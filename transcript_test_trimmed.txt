hey good morning so to recap what we learned yesterday and employees there's two ways or actually three ways to get into the employee Master record you could double click on the icon of the person and that will bring up the sign list

0:00:24,300s ---> 0:00:57,100s
and then you double-click once you choose the person in the master record you're not only going to have one screen you have the history screen education screen you know what I did not mention this so I will mention this today the adjustment screen I don't know how I missed out yesterday but the adjustment screen is going to be for child support court garnishment or any

deductions that have to be taken out of the employee's paycheck that has nothing to do with taxes just isn't strictly deductions that I needed to be taken out for either like background checks or as I mentioned child support or equipment that you might lend out or rent or Buy and they have to pay it so normally the way that this works is when you get a child support document you could always call tech support and they will walk you step-by-step in order to add it into the records but just as an overview this site here is all the child support or all the deductions that Melissa has when you click then the left hand side is the detail of that equipment or. Deduction so we can see here that this was a one-time deduction cuz it says one time

and she paid $15 for that equipment so you can set up in the production section deductions that are not already included and codes for in background check or equipment or bus tickets or taxi tickets are things like that okay so that is the adjustment screen and it's I know it's a little weird we do it here in
